It was originally planned that a German commando in Polish uniforms would capture a radio transmitter in Gleiwitz, Silesia, and broadcast on the German national airwaves a call to the people of Silesia to rise up against Germany, in the form of a provocative message insulting the National-Sozialist regime.\n\nThe general organization of the plan was smoothly carried out, 6 men of the Sicherheitsdienst were selected by Himmler's subordinates and the head of the Gestapo took care of providing 12 criminals to be left for dead at the place of the operation, finally an industrialist with connections in the Abwehr took care of providing us with Polish weapons and uniforms.\n\nOn the day of the operation, the 6 SDs and 12 prisoners took control of the transmitter station, despite an unexpected problem that prevented the message from being diffused over the entire country, the operation went as planned and at the end the prisoners were shot and left behind.\n\nSeveral journalists were then quickly summoned to report on the attack, and it was immediately used as a pretext to start the invasion."

Indeed, during the campaign, the Germans ended up capturing some territories that had been assigned to our sphere of influence, it would be completely out of the question to leave out the easternmost territories, since that is where almost all the minorities of Poland we are officially supposed to protect are located, the territories of central Poland however are of lesser importance to us.\n\nWe could ask the Germans to withdraw our two armies from the territories assigned to each other in good order so as to begin the occupation that had been foreseen by the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact. But we could also request a renegotiation of the treaty in order to redraw the borders of our spheres of influence, for example by offering the Germans to exchange the territories in central Poland that they captured for something else?"

Indeed, during the campaign, we ended up capturing some territories that had been assigned to the Soviet sphere of influence.\n\nAs such the Soviets have approached us asking if it would be possible to renegotiate the territorial clauses of the pact accordingly, informing us that they are mostly interested in the easternmost territories, and that therefore they would be willing to exchange us a few territories closer to the center."
 pol_par_his_ger.5.a:0 "Sure, let's propose them Lithuania in exchange for the contested territories."

However, if we think about it, it could allow us to lay the foundations of a large puppet state in the East, or even simply serve as a small buffer between East Prussia and the Soviet Union.\n\nWith such vague ambitions, it goes without saying that the Reich government is quite divided on the subject. That is, for the few who have any opinion on it.\n\nA first suggestion given would be simply to take control of the country and make it a puppet state, a second one proposes the same operation but with the annexation of the territories West of the Vilnia river, and finally a more radical one suggests an outright annexation of the whole country.\n\nGiven the general inability to find a solution, the personal choice of the Führer will be decisive.
