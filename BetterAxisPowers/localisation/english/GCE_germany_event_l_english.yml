Now Macarthur has requested to continue his military career and we have would just the place for him in the Wehrmacht: Nord Amerika.

 GCE_GER.43.desc:0 "In an day long intorigation by our most expirenced SS Intorigators and at last Heinrich Himmler himself Douglas Macarthur broke out in an Anti-Nazi rant and how he would never betray the American dream that he'd rather die standing then kneel before an foreign invader. This has taken Heinrich Himmler by suprise who had to call SS assistance to contain the enraged Douglas Macarthur. Non the less Douglas Macarthur is a brilliant military mind and the Führer hoped to convince him to lead the Nord Amerikanische Wehrmacht. \n\nJosef Mengele on the otherhand has promised us great results in the change of mind of Douglas Macarthur but his methodes are not always the most humane.."

 GCE_GER.44.desc:0 "Today Josef Mengele reports success on the case 'Bold Eagle' Douglas Macarthur. \n\nHis methode seems to have changed the mind of the bold Macarthur and completly erased his loyality for the former United States of America. While now being loyal to National Socialism and the Führer Macarthur seems a little bit on the light headed side of things and honestly said a bit crazy. His miliary expierence has also suffered but not to the unusable point. He is still up there with our best military minds and fit for the position of General Feldmarschall von Nord Amerika."

We shall help them return to Afrika and do so in pride. \n\nDegenerate Continent. \nWe have to accept that North America is a degenerate continent and it might bring the stability knowing that most of their way of life will not change.
