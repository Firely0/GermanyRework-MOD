 wargn.110.d:0 "The German Blitzkrieg knows no end, as of today the city of Rome has fallen into German hands. \n\nFighting in the city was unexpectidly swift as many of the Italian defenders retreated or simply gave up due to a desire to keep the historical city and its monuments intact. \n\nUltimately, the German flag was raised over the Colosseum, and to mock the defeated Italians a Triumph in the style of the Romans was held in the city with cries of "Heil Hermann!" being heard all around. \n\nThe Italian hope of a new Rome has now seemingly been put to rest."
